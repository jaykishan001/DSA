stl standarrd tamplete library
 buts/stdc++ it is a library to include all the library in program 
 we have all the librabry in stdc++\

 c++ stl divided into four parts 
 1 algorithms
 2 Container - vector, queue, set, map
 3 Functions
 4 Iterators - 

 pair is the part of utilities library if we want to store two variable we use pair

 pair <int, int> p = {1, 3};
 cout<<p.first <<"" << p.second;

 pair<int , pair<int,int>> p = {1, {2,3}};
 cout<<""p.first<<"" <<p.second.second<< " "<<p.second.first;
